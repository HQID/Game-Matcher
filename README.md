## 🤖 AI Integration

Game Matcher utilizes the **IBM Granite model** (`granite-3.3-8b-instruct`), served via Replicate API, to generate contextual and creative game recommendations.

### 🔁 AI Workflow:

1. User preferences (mood, genre, inspiration) are sent from the frontend to the backend (`/api/find-game`).
2. The backend constructs a dynamic prompt based on this input.
3. The prompt is sent to IBM Granite via the Replicate API.
4. The AI model returns a structured JSON response containing:

   * `game_name`
   * `platform`
   * `summary`
   * `tips` (3 items)
